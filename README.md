Iâ€™m a Data Scientist with a deep interest in unravelling complex datasets, particularly when it involves sports statistics. My expertise centres on machine learning, statistical modelling, and data visualisation, with a technical toolkit spanning Python to Azure. Iâ€™m especially drawn to analysing football results, Formula 1 performance, and darts trends, where I apply data science to uncover meaningful patterns.

Any further write-ups on my work can be found [here](https://atredshaw.github.io/).

## My Expertise
- **Machine Learning & Predictive Modelling**: I develop models to simplify processes and bring clarity to complex problems, such as probabilistic xG models for football or forecasting trends in business operations.
- **Technical Tools**: Iâ€™m well-versed in Python (Scikit-Learn, Pandas, NumPy, PuLP), SQL, Azure SQL DB, and Alteryx, alongside creating impactful dashboards with Power BI and Tableau.
- **Cloud Computing**: I have practical experience with Azure, including the [AI-900: AI Fundamentals](https://learn.microsoft.com/api/credentials/share/en-gb/AlexRedshawUK-7850/67A0F1144119022E?sharingId=C183137B04FE9A8C) certification, as well as working towards the DP-100 Data Science Associate. This is complemented by a more light-touch exposure to GCP and AWS.

## My Experience
In my current role in Data & Analytics, I apply data to solve real-world challenges, such as improving operational efficiency and anticipating future trends. During my university years, I blended academic rigour with practical application, researching and writing a first-class dissertation on probabilistic machine learning for football analysis (focusing on xG and win prediction), as well as conducted a project exploring ethical opinions through video game activity. These experiences fuel my ongoing work, where I combine code, data, and curiosity to drive results.

## Current Focus
- Developing a whole host of predictive models for sports performance analysis and forecasting
- Experimenting with optimisation techniques using a combination of PuLP and ML generated data - Particularly in the sphere of fantasy sports (Fantasy Premier League (FPL) & Fantasy F1)
- Advancing my Azure expertise towards the DP-100 certification.
